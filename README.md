# LeetCodeSubstringWithConcatenation

My submission for the https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/ HARD leetcode challenge.

For this one I jumped the shark at the start. Here's me looking at how to calculate permutations of words when all I really needed was a two-pointer solution. 
After revising the "sliding windows" algorithm I was a bit miffed it is so easy.

My code is original, its not based off anyone else's. You can use it to learn but please don't submit it to Leetcode, that's just cheating.


**Current iteration:**

Runtime: 1184 ms, faster than 18.84% of C# online submissions for Substring with Concatenation of All Words.
Memory Usage: 46.3 MB, less than 42.51% of C# online submissions for Substring with Concatenation of All Words.

Not too shabby, but not where I want to be. I suspect the substr() calls are slowing it down somewhat.
